Try to update your webpack dependencies with the following command

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
if it does not work then use as following

I am having these dependencies but I faced the same issue

"webpack": "^5.6.0",
"webpack-cli": "^4.2.0",
"webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.0"
And I found a solution that adding a new script or in your Start Script in package.json worked for me. So you can try this way as well.

 "dev": "webpack serve --mode development --env development"
